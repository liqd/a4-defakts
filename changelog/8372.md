### Added

- add a new important page `FAQ` to wagtail
- add XAI labels and description
- the ai_report serializer now returns the url of the new FAQ page

### Changed

- the ai_report serializer now returns the label and a description of the label
- the ai_report serializer now filters out `catnodecis` and `catneutral` as they
  are meaningless for the frontend
- ai_reports which have no labels are not shown in the dashboard. Together with
  the change above this means ai_reports which only have `catnodecis`,
`catneutral` or both will no longer be shown.
- the ai_report serializer no longer returns the explanation as a string but as
  json now
